# Mini ETL Task

This project demonstrates a basic ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline using **Python**, **pandas**, and **AWS S3**. It reads a CSV dataset from an S3 bucket, performs data transformation in Python, and writes the processed output back to S3. The workflow uses `boto3` for interacting with S3 and `python-dotenv` for managing credentials securely.
